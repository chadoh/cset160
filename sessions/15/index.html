# [Status Quo Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias)

???

One of the human brain's many biases (that is, one of its tricks for sorting through the overflow of data in the universe) is the Status Quo Bias.

We are biased to think that the current state of affairs is the optimum, even if there's strong evidence to the contrary.

when an engineer screws up

--

* it's obvious
--

* there's a bug
--

* the code is unreadable

---

when a *product manager* screws up

--

* it's the status quo
--

* the whole *team* suffers
--

* it might not be obvious there's a problem
--

* *engineers* might blame themselves for the difficulties

---

when a *teacher* screws up


* it's the status quo
* the whole *class* suffers
* it might not be obvious there's a problem
* *students* might blame themselves for the difficulties

???

Which is to say, the whole _class_ suffers.

???

Which brings us to this. This score distribution could be read as "almost all
the students are dumb." But a simpler explanation is that the teacher screwed
up.

To pass the test would require, I believe, a very basic understanding of Ruby
and Rails. If you did poorly, then you lack such a basic understanding. If
everyone did poorly, then the teacher did a poor job of imparting that basic
understanding.
