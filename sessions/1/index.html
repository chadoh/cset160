a heroic browser, a thoughtful server, and the friends who help them talk to each other

Ok, so lots of stuff happens between your browser and the server

--

But how do they actually talk to each other?

---

# http

--

a protocol

...


???

Define what a protocol is; go over GET vs POST; learn to inspect network requests in the Chrome inspector (set up a simple app on Heroku?)

Confusing as it is, a process called a _server_ runs on the _server_. Sheesh. Naming things is hard!

1. So, the server _process_ sits there, always waiting by the phone, waiting for someone to call.
2. When someone calls, the _server process_ can handle the request itself, such as for handing back simple `.html` or `.png` files.
3. For more complicated pages, the _server process_ can pass the request on to a script. This script can use Ruby or any other language.
4. The script can access a database if it needs to.
5. Ultimately, the script will create an `.html` file or similar. This is what gets sent back to the client.

What are web languages?

How does the client-side vs server-side idea play into the notion of web languages?

David Heinemeier Hansson (dhh) created Ruby on Rails in 2004. Like many others who were attracted to Ruby in the early and mid '00s, dhh was a Java refugee.

* Rails helped popularize Ruby in US
* Rails inspired many other web frameworks
* Rails is still a popular choice for building websites

# an *excerpt*

???

&gt; My conscience wonâ€™t let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply that the language works primarily on the computerâ€™s terms. That the language is designed to accommodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore, we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computerâ€™s locale. Itâ€™s the computerâ€™s language and we are translators for the world.
&gt;
&gt; But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that language? When you start to use the languageâ€™s own words and colloquialisms to express yourself. Say, the computer canâ€™t do that. How can it be the computerâ€™s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!
