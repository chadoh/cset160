Review: remember the client-server model?

Confusing as it is, a process called a _server_ runs on the _server_. Sheesh. Naming things is hard!

1. So, the server _process_ sits there, always waiting by the phone, waiting for someone to call.
2. When someone calls, the _server process_ can handle the request itself, such as for handing back simple `.html` or `.png` files.
3. For more complicated pages, the _server process_ can pass the request on to a script. This script can use Ruby or any other language.
4. The script can access a database if it needs to.
5. Ultimately, the script will create an `.html` file or similar. This is what gets sent back to the client.

# Let's try it

start [here](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/)

???

1. Download as a zip, without the commit history.
2. Save to new folder.
3. Commit my starting code to git.
4. As you work, work on a new branch.

Tour of the code, explanation of everything that's happening.

* Rack
* config.ru
* Reading the output from `rackup` to find the port
* Running on a different port with `rackup -p 3000`?
* Walking through the README

# Lab: Make a list

Use [my example app](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/) as a
starting point. Modify it to list whatever-you-want instead of Students. Make
sure it still does all these things:

* list items
* create new items
* delete items

Do your work *on a branch*. Make a Pull Request, and send me a link! By EOD Monday. I'll review before class next Wednesday.

Tip: Make a typeform or Google Form for submitting link to their PR, so it's easy to keep track of who submitted so far.
