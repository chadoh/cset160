CSET 160.2

# server to browser

Using Ruby to send a webpage

attendance

# some kind of list

what do you want to list? cities, movies, todos, bands, vegetables?

&lt;small&gt;(*keep it simple*)&lt;/small&gt;

Review: remember the client-server model?

# Let's perform a play

a heroic browser, a thoughtful server, and the friends who help them talk to each other

# That was fun! Let's think about it a different way.

Confusing as it is, a process called a _server_ runs on the _server_. Sheesh. Naming things is hard!

1. So, the server _process_ sits there, always waiting by the phone, waiting for someone to call.
2. When someone calls, the _server process_ can handle the request itself, such as for handing back simple `.html` or `.png` files.
3. For more complicated pages, the _server process_ can pass the request on to a script. This script can use Ruby or any other language.
4. The script can access a database if it needs to.
5. Ultimately, the script will create an `.html` file or similar. This is what gets sent back to the client.

Taken from [Building a 30 line HTTP server in Ruby](https://blog.appsignal.com/2016/11/23/ruby-magic-building-a-30-line-http-server-in-ruby.html). Their tutorial digs into the specifics more, and is really helpful!

# Let's use [Rack]

  [Rack]: https://rack.github.io/

???

Rack is the foundation of basically any Ruby web framework, however big or small. You can even use it by itself to make web apps, and it's not as bad as you might think. Check out http://hawkins.io/2012/07/rack_from_the_beginning/

# Let's use [Rack]

Make your `app.rb` look like [this file](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/blob/30526243763fe9b5bd17727020dc3a4718941f1f/app.rb)

```bash
$ gem install rack

Do you see something like this?

1. &lt;strike&gt;Sign up for Heroku&lt;/strike&gt;
2. &lt;strike&gt;Set up Heroku cli&lt;/strike&gt;
3. Modify app to work with Heroku

---

class: small

## 3. Modify app to work with Heroku

Add [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) with this in it:

```ruby
web: ruby app.rb -p $PORT
```

???

The Procfile (process file), as described in the link, tells Heroku how to run your app. The `web:` at the beginning tells it that this should be a _web_ process. Heroku allows other kinds of processes, too. We'll learn about those in the Rails part of the class.

--

&lt;small&gt;
Try it out:

```bash
$ ruby app.rb -p 5678
```
&lt;/small&gt;

---

class: small

## 3. Modify app to work with Heroku

Add [Gemfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-support#general-support-activation) with this in it:

``` ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
ruby "2.5.0" # make sure this matches `ruby -v`

gem "rack"

```

???

The Gemfile, as described in the link, tells Heroku that this is a Ruby app. Not all Ruby apps use Bundler (`Gemfile` is a convention used by Bundler), but enough do that Heroku thought it made sense for this to be the trigger.

---

class: small

## 3. Modify app to work with Heroku

Set up [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to work with that Gemfile.

``` bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

You'll see that you now have a `Gemfile.lock`

---

class: small

## 3. Modify app to work with Heroku

Don't hard-code the port number!

---

class: small

## 3. Modify app to work with Heroku

Don't hard-code the port number! Change this

``` bash
:Port =&gt; 5678
```

--

to this

``` bash
:Port =&gt; ENV['PORT'] || 5678
```

--

This tells Rack to use the [environment variable set by Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars), or to use 5678 if it isn't defined

---

btw, you can try out that `ENV` thing like this:

```bash
$ PORT=1234 ruby app.rb
```

Then open up `localhost:1234`

---

class: small

## 3. Modify app to work with Heroku

Commit &amp; push to GitHub

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit
$ git push
```

---

let's deploy on [Heroku][heroku]

  [heroku]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/start

1. &lt;strike&gt;Sign up for Heroku&lt;/strike&gt;
2. &lt;strike&gt;Set up Heroku cli&lt;/strike&gt;
3. &lt;strike&gt;Modify app to work with Heroku&lt;/strike&gt;
4. `git push heroku`

a [stupid simple](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/commit/1d64dd429dc21bcd703419e2603adb8bdaf67e6f) way to add routing

---

oh but we need to mind our [http status codes](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/commit/e4b041efaff7d9ed952e07608b8de148af17d17d)

and how about [a layout](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/commit/c4576c691803df012806976a6ed05cf6e3d8a413)

let's learn about [rackup](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/commit/2e26ef8dbe78774edaeab69a2602383ca47ae6a9)

pro tip: tack `?w=1` to the end of that URL

---

Commit &amp; deploy!

---

ok but what is a realer way to do this

---

# microframeworks!

---

👉 http://cuba.is/

---

change your Gemfile

```diff
- gem "rack"
+ gem "cuba"
+ gem "tilt"
```

then `bundle install`

???

Does Cuba rely on Rack? How can you check?

---

Switch [the whole way over](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/commit/707b2d1352c57ab1e84de0a3091d376350a5fc77)

* Commit &amp; push to github
* `git push heroku`

Make it [safe](https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/commit/af8a46ef03efe5933e167b83075c68c166509abc)!

```diff
 require "cuba"
+require "cuba/safe"
 require "cuba/render"
 require "erb"

+Cuba.use Rack::Session::Cookie, :secret =&gt; ENV["SESSION_SECRET"] || "__a_very_long_string__"
+
+Cuba.plugin Cuba::Safe
 Cuba.plugin Cuba::Render
```

---

* Commit &amp; push to github
* `git push heroku`

---

restart your server while you work

```bash
$ gem install rerun rb-fsevent
$ rerun rackup
```

--

&lt;small&gt;
There are ways to do this other than [rerun](https://github.com/alexch/rerun), it was just the first one I found
&lt;/small&gt;

---

What about *databases*?

---

Let's [use SQLite3][sqlite3-example]

  [sqlite3-example]: https://github.com/chadoh/cset160-2-bare-bones-ruby/commit/a476b38140120a388528d83c2f4e905c9381278a

--

(This won't work with Heroku)

---

class: small

# Lab: Make your Cuba app list something

* list all items (like [my example][sqlite3-example])
* have a `/new` page with a form
* handle form submission at a new route, and add a new **X** to your database
* allow deleting items

Do this work *on a branch*. Make a Pull Request, and send me a link! By EOD Monday. I'll review before class next Wednesday.
